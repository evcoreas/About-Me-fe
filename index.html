					<p>Hello my name is Erika Coreas! I am currently a student at Lehman College pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems. Also, on a journey to create beautiful websites such as this one! I have a passion for crafting, driving and nature. I enjoy learning about anything that is related to technology. I have three dogs, which bring much joy into my life as well as inspiration. On my spare time, I enjoy driving to Bear Mountain State Park. The scenery inspires my inner creativity with all the colors that change throughout the year. The views and hiking at the mountain are breath taking. On warm days in the spring and summer I enjoy going to a racetrack that is located in Englishtown, NJ. The smell of tires being spun and brunt gives me excitement. I also enjoy playing a variety video games.

					If you would like to take a glimpse look in to my life please take a look at my Photo Gallery to meet my dogs and a great number of photos I have taken! Also check out some of my favorite quotes.</p>
